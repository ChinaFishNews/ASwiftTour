let john = Person()

//let roomCount = john.residence!.numberOfRooms  // This triggers a runtime error

// ================ Accessing Properties Through Optional Chaining =============

    print("Function was called.")
    
    let someAddress = Address()
    someAddress.buildingNumber = "29"

john.residence?.address = createAddress() // If `john.residence` is nil, the `createAddress()` is not called, because nothing is printed.



// ================== Calling Methods Through Optional Chaining ====================


// If you call this method on an optional value with optional chaining, the methodâ€™s return type will be Void?, not Void, because return values are always of an optional type when called through optional chaining. This enables you to use an if statement to check whether it was possible to call the printNumberOfRooms() method
if john.residence?.printNumberOfRooms() != nil {
    print("It was possible to print the number of rooms.")
} else {
    print("It was not possible to print the number of rooms.")
}



// Any attempt to set a property through optional chaining returns a value of type Void?, which enables you to compare against nil to see if the property was set successfully
if (john.residence?.address = someAddress) != nil {
    print("It was possible to set the address.")
} else {
    print("It was not possible to set the address.")
}

// ================= Accessing Subscripts Through Optional Chaining =================

let johnHouse = Residence()
johnHouse.rooms.append(Room.init(name: "Living Room"))
johnHouse.rooms.append(Room.init(name: "BathRoom"))
johnHouse.rooms.append(Room.init(name: "Kitchen"))
john.residence = johnHouse

// You can use optional chaining to try to retrieve a value from subscript on an optional value, but you still need to make sure the index is not out of range
if let firstRoomName = john.residence?[0].name {
    
    print("The first room name is \(firstRoomName).")
    
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the first room name.")
}

var testScores = ["Dave": [86, 82, 84], "Bev": [79, 90, 81]]
testScores["Dave"]?[0] = 91
testScores["Bev"]?[0] += 1
testScores["Brian"]?[0] = 72

// ==================== Linking Multiple Levels of Chaining ================

if let johnStreet = john.residence?.address?.street {
    print("John's street name is \(johnStreet)")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the address.")
}

let johnAddress = Address()
johnAddress.buildingName = "The Larches"
johnAddress.street = "Laurel Street"
john.residence?.address = johnAddress


if let johnsStreet = john.residence?.address?.street {
    print("John's street name is \(johnsStreet).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the address.")
}




// ===== Chaining on Methods with Optional Return Values =============

if let buildingIdentifier = john.residence?.address?.buildingIdentifier() {
    print("John's building identifier is \(buildingIdentifier)")
}

if let beginsWithThe = john.residence?.address?.buildingIdentifier()?.hasPrefix("The") {
    if beginsWithThe {
        print("John's building identifier begins with \"The\".")
    } else {

    }
}
